### Abstract
pyVISCOUS is the open-source code of VISCOUS (VarIance-based Sensitivity analysis using COpUlaS) in Python. VISCOUS is a copula-based framework for efficient global sensitivity analysis. It was developed by Sheikholeslami et al. ([2021](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR028435)) and improved by Liu et al. (2023). The advantage of VISCOUS is that it can estimate Sobolâ€™ first-order and total-order sensitivity indices by using existing input-output data (e.g., model parameters-responses data) without requiring additional model runs. 

In other words, VISCOUS is a given-data approach (also known as data-driven approach). It can be implemented regardless of whether the underlying relationship or mechanism between input and output data is known. It also enables the application of gloabl sensitivity analysis to computationally intensive models by generating reliable sensitivity estimates with minimal computational resources. 

Within the VISCOUS framework, the following steps are included.

### Installation
#### From PyPI
```pip install pyviscous```

#### From source

Clone pyviscous with: ```git clone https://github.com/CH-Earth/pyviscous.git```

Then navigate to the pyviscous directory and install with: ```python setup.py install```

### Examples
We provide four example notebooks in the example directory. In each example, there are scripts to generate input-output data, set up and run VISCOUS, and evaluate the sensitivity results.
